# How-to-use-LM-35-temperature-sensor-with-Arduino
LM35 is a temperature measuring device having an analog output voltage proportional to the temperature. It provides output voltage in Centigrade (Celsius). ... The sensitivity of LM35 is 10 mV/degree Celsius. As temperature increases, output voltage also increases. Connect the sensor pin to the analog pin of Arduino uno, VCC to 5v and GND to GND.
